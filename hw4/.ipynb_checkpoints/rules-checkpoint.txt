Competition 4

Goal: prediction of the Prognosis column
Evaluation metric: balanced accuracy

Subcompetition 1: use SVM for the prediction (you can use other models for data imputation)
Subcompetition 2: freeform

DATA DESCRIPTION
Predict the severity of COVID-19 in patients of Italian hospitals. The data is collected from 6 hospitals. Chest X-ray images are provided for each patient, which are collected in imgs.npy. Usage of the images are not required for either competition, but it is allowed.
